# Python and PyQt6: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator (PyCalc)

PyCalc is a sample calculator implemented using Python 3 and with a [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/introduction.html) GUI. Fundamentally, PyCalc implements basic math operations, such as; division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction.

PyCalc is an example of how to build a Python + PyQt6 GUI application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It was created by following the tutorial and article at RealPython, titled "[Python and PyQt: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator](https://realpython.com/python-and-pyqt-building-a-gui-desktop-calculator/)".

## Folder Content

The current folder, `materials-pyqt-calculator/`, hosts two subfolders:

1. `examples/` contains the source file of every example in the tutorial.
2. `pycalc/` stores the code and related resources for your PyQt Calculator app.

## Requirements

For PyCalc to work, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.6.1. Then you need to install the PyQt6 library. You can do this by using `pip` in a Python virtual environment:

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install pyqt6
```

After these commands have finished, you can run PyCalc as described in the next section.

## How to Run PyCalc

To run PyCalc from your system's command line or terminal, execute the following command:

```console
$ python pycalc.py
```

After running this command, you'll get PyCalc running on your machine.

## How to Use PyCalc

To use PyCalc, just enter a valid math expression using your mouse and then press `Enter` or click the `=` button to get the result.
